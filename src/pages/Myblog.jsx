        <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-6 text-center">
          Hello and welcome to my blog! I’m Anurag Choudhary, and I’m truly glad
          you’re here. This blog is more than just a collection of posts — it’s
          a personal space where I explore thoughts, share knowledge, and
          document experiences that have shaped me. Whether you’re here to learn
          something new, find inspiration, or just explore, I hope you’ll leave
          with something valuable.

          My Background
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          I come from a background rooted in curiosity and a love for learning.
          From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by how things work —
          whether it was dismantling gadgets, exploring websites, or simply
          asking “why?” more times than people could count. As I grew, that
          curiosity found a home in technology and creativity. I started to
          explore coding, design, and digital tools, and that led me to develop
          skills in web development, problem-solving, and content creation. I
          learned by doing — experimenting, failing, fixing, and improving. Over
          time, I realized I didn’t want to just consume knowledge; I wanted to
          share it, too. That’s how this blog began — as an outlet for
          self-expression, learning, and community.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-300 mb-2 mt-8">
          Why I Started This Blog
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          I’ve always believed that knowledge becomes more powerful when it’s
          shared. There’s something deeply satisfying about taking what you
          know, shaping it into a story or tutorial, and watching someone else
          benefit from it. That’s the main reason I started this blog — to share
          what I learn, one topic at a time. Whether it’s explaining a concept
          in web development, sharing life lessons, reviewing tools, or just
          reflecting on everyday experiences, I use this platform to put my
          thoughts into words. Also, writing helps me think clearly. It slows me
          down and gives me time to reflect, question, and grow. This blog is a
          mirror of that growth.

          My Interests and Passions

              Technology & Web Development:
            </span>{" "}
            I love building things. Coding, especially in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            and frameworks like React, excites me. I enjoy solving real-world
            problems through software and sharing simple explanations so others
            can learn, too.

              Learning & Self-Growth:
            </span>{" "}
            I believe in lifelong learning. I’m always looking for ways to grow
            — professionally, creatively, and personally. Books, courses,
            podcasts, and conversations are a big part of that journey.

              Writing & Communication:
            </span>{" "}
            Words have power. I find joy in writing clearly, telling stories,
            and helping others understand something new. Whether it’s a how-to
            guide or a personal reflection, writing has always been a core part
            of who I am.

              Creativity & Design:
            </span>{" "}
            I’m drawn to visual expression. Whether it's designing a webpage,
            editing a photo, or curating a layout — I find balance in mixing
            logic with creativity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Outside of these, I also enjoy exploring topics like productivity,
            minimalism, and mindset. I like discussing things that help us live
            better and more intentionally.

          My Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          I believe in progress over perfection. Life is a journey — and whether
          it's in learning a new skill or figuring out who you are, what matters
          most is showing up consistently and growing bit by bit. I also believe
          in helping without expecting. Much of what I’ve learned came from
          strangers on the internet — blog posts, videos, and forums. If I can
          give back by doing the same for someone else, that’s a win. And
          finally, I believe in being authentic. This blog isn’t about
          pretending to be perfect or knowing everything. It’s about being real,
          staying curious, and learning out loud.

          <li>
            I prefer simplicity over complexity, both in code and in life.
          </li>
